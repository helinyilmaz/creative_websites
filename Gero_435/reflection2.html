<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Although the experience of aging is universal, women, or those born with or transitioned to female sex, traverse the path of aging distinctly, at both a biological and a social level. Aging and its implications vary for women in the areas of autoimmune disease, neurodegenertative disease, hormones, and menopause. Female hormone cycling systems, as well as immune responses during and after pregnancy and menopause contribute to variations that are observed in aging between women and men. By addressing both biological and social factors that influence aging, and analyzing how these factors particularly affect women, we gain a better understanding of why women experience aging differently than men. </p>

<h2>Topics Addressing the Prompt</h2>
<h3>Neurodegenerative Diseases</h3>
<p>Before discussing the factors that contribute to a unique experience of aging for women, it is important to address aging in the context of men. Men are at a higher risk of neurogdenerative diseases like Parkinson’s disease, while women are at more risk of Alzheimer’s. Additionally, one study reported that a high-fat diet did not lead to the same level of inflammation in the brain for males as it did for females. In fact, female mice (as animals are commonly used in studies of health research) displayed an upregulation of their immune system and inflammation with a high-fat diet, while males did not. Scientists have attributed some observed patterns of variation to changes that occur in embryonic development, which implies that some of the heightened risks or advantages that males and females have are not controllable. It is interesting to think about how small differences beginning in embryonic development can lead to greater changes in adulthood. Such differences suggest that it is important to address and consider sex as a factor that can lead to different health outcomes. </p>

<h3>Brain Basics</h3>
<p>Although there are clear patterns across neurodegenerative diseases and their prevalence in men and women, it is unreasonable to argue that male/female brains exist. Certainly, there are differences, but these differences do not necessarily constitute a male or female brain. Research has show than men tend to use their right amygdala more, while women use the left amygdala, and that male brain amygalas are more “lit up” in MRI scans. What this can potentially mean is that men tend to focus on the big picture rather than details, and that they are more likely to react with strong emotion. An interesting point is that testosterone enhances amygdala activity, and it is higher in men. Certainly, we can see these differences in our friends and family, but it would still be incorrect to denote a male or female brain from a simple brain scane comparison. Instead, this information can be used to tailor care and treatment, and make health suggestions for all brains. </p>


<h3>Autoimmune Disease</h3>
<p>Autoimmune disease occurs when the immune system is unable to distinguish harmful cells from its own, attacking an individual’s own cells. Autoimmune disease is a risk associated with the experience of aging, and it can be used as a metric to assess the aging experience of women and men. Furthermore, autoimmune diseases are nearly twice as prevalent in women than in men, raising curiosity as to why this trend exists. Some researchers have theorized that because women now spend less time pregnant overall, in contrast to earlier humans that had more children beginning at a younger age, the overly active immune system is not being utilized as much. The reason why pregnancy can potentially help in regulating the immune system in a healthy way, so the system does not attack itself, is because it increases immune system activity. Another way to observe the effect of pregnancy is with the increase of estrogen and thus, inflammatory properties of the placenta. It is important to note that in some cases, pregnancy may lead to the onset of autoimmune disease if the mother’s immune system was already active, and thus experiences hyperactivation.
Essentially, the male and female immune systems differ, which leads to variations in aging. These variations occur due to the fact that women are at a much greater risk of autoimmune disease than men. Another theory used to explain the observed difference in autoimmune disease in women and men is that having two X chromosomes increases the risk of having a genetic mutation (by a factor of 2) in women. To summarize, the female immune system is pro-inflammatory and hyperactive, with the intent to protect new life that is made during pregnancy. Additionally, female immune systems are more cytotoxic and have more T-cell activity.
</p>
<h3>Hormones</h3>
<p>Hormones, particularly, estrogen, play a significant role in women’s health and aging. Estrogen levels are much higher in women, and because it is a fat-soluble molecule, it passes through membranes of cells. In the context of menopause, estrogen levels have a signficant influence in the experiences that women have, and many studies have reported varying levels of estrogen in racial groups, such that African-American women have higher levels of estradiol compared to Caucausian women. In addition to these seemingly inherent differences, women’s health and aging experience can vary depending on lifestyle choices, including attidudes toward homeopathic medicine, diet, and exercise. Of course, looking at aging from the perspective of women must also include the added factor of stress during and after pregnancy and menopause, as these experiences can drastically change hormonal balance, and even immune response in women. </p>

<h2>How Topics Relate to Each Other</h2>
<h3>Why Does This All Matter?</h3>
<p>These factors all display how health and the experience of aging is unique in women, and how most of these differences are out of the control of each individual because they are biological. Several studies have proposed sex-specific treatment and preemptive care, considering the fact that autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases vary in the sexes. For instance, Alzheimer’s affects women at a larger rate, while Parkinson’s affects men more. Perhaps most importantly, with the amount of information and evidence currently available that supports the fact that women experience aging differently, it is crucial that there is more research that addresses these differences in sex so that we gain a better understanding of the risks associated with our health. Research must continue to address sex differences and use a diverse subject pool when conducting studies or collecting information so that its findings are more applicable to the general population.

<h2>How Topics Relate to My Experiences</h2>
<p>As an individual born female, with two X chromosomes, learning about the differences that exist between health and aging in males and females has certainly enlightened my observation of my own body. Although going through pregnancy is a choice, experiencing menopause is something that the majority of women who age face, which has made me believe that more women need to learn about what to expect during, before, and after menopause. Its symptoms sometimes begin 2 years in advance, but I doubt that most women are able to recognize or pay close attention to their changing health because we lack adequate education on this subject. Reading the articles and study results of experiments that aimed to reveal differences in health and disease in men and women was incredibly insightful and prompted me to share this information with my aging family and friends. It is important to know how to protect ourselves as best we can, but also accept that unfortunately, some risks are uncontrollable.

<h2>Why I Chose to Reflect This Way</h2>

<p>I’ve been developing websites for one of the courses I’m taking this semester and I thought it would be fun to integrate what I’ve been learning in that course with the material that we have been covering. In a lot of our discussion posts, my classmates and I have been brainstorming ways to share this information about aging and women’s health with the general population, so I thought it would be a good idea to explore my creativity in making an interactive and easily accessible website that I can share with friends and family. I wanted to link the articles that we have read and written about in our discussion posts, so that the information I am sharing can be accredited to the appropriate sources. Also, those that want to read more in depth about the topics I present on my website can do so by following the links to the articles. Essentially, I had the goal of making an interactive infographic that could function as a summary of the topics that are included for our second reflection.</p>
