        <h3>Hormones</h3>
        <p>This paper presents interesting findings regarding the effect of oxytocin on the testosterone-cortisol ratio and how this influences levels of trustworthiness in men. Both hormones are recognized as a single influencing factor based on the dual-hormone hypothesis, which applies because a high testosterone-cortisol ratio is correlated to anger, risk-taking behavior, aggression, social dominance, and stress. Participants played the trust game, with an investor and trustee and experienced betrayal in the second round after receiving much lower sums of monetary units. The results revealed that participants with a higher testosterone-cortisol ratio exhibited more "reciprocity" after this betrayal, but that these results are altered under the administration of oxytocin. Thus, the study concluded that oxytocin hinders the normal effects of the testosterone-cortisol ratio in its relationship to trustworthiness, risk-taking behavior, and reciprocity. Furthermore, the most notable disparity between participants that received oxytocin and those that were given a placebo was in the third phase of the Trust Game after the betrayal phase. This implies that oxytocin reduces trustworthiness in men with a high testosterone-cortisol ratio.

The study addresses its limitation in that all participants were male, and thus, the results are not directly applicable to females. As a means of control, participants with a history of drug or substance use, smoking, and trauma from “acute stress disorder” were not included. Although these factors are considered and participants are filtered out to support the validity of results, I think it is essential to reproduce such studies for individuals with various health backgrounds. How relevant are the results of this study to the average American, and can we scale these results to accommodate the entire population, if this were necessary? How can researchers recognize and balance the influence of such social factors when assessing their biological effects? </p>

          <h3>Menopause</h3>
          <p>The article, “Racial and Ethnic Differences in the Physiology and Clinical Symptoms of Menopause,” discusses various studies and methods researchers have performed to observe racial/ethnic determinants or differences in menopause across women of different backgrounds. Factors that can influence the timing and overall health outcome of aging women and their menopausal experience include stress, socioeconomic status, education, and marital status. The paper notes that so far, very few studies have been conducted to assess biological differences among various racial groups of women, even though the population of non-white women in the United States has been increasing, and the need to care for the individual needs and menopausal issues of these women is a growing concern. A lack of sufficient data collection and analysis of women of different racial/ethnic backgrounds in the specific timing of menopause impedes the development of a clear conclusion about such experiences. The article mentions that hormones may be used as biomarkers of ovarian function and that one study discovered estradiol levels were greater in African American women compared to Caucasian women. However, there needs to be more research conducted to fully understand the causes for such a difference, and whether these results are observed in a greater population sample. There certainly appears to be room for discovery and improvement in understanding menopause and its symptoms, as well as how it may vary in women of various backgrounds by including diverse perspectives.

It was very interesting to read about how doctor visits vs. asking elders about menopausal symptom management, taking medication vs. holistic medicine, avoiding vs. pursuing healthy foods, etc varied among women of different ethnic backgrounds and these differences show how much our cultures can influence our relationship with health.

One question I have after reading the article is, assuming that sufficient research has been conducted and the factors that most influence women's menopause in various racial/ethnic groups are determined, how should health care providers approach this information, given the fact that most of the dietary and lifestyle choices are cultural? In other words, what tangible changes can be encouraged without overstepping the boundaries of people with diverse backgrounds? How can education play a role in this change?

          <h3>Immune System</h3>
          <p>These articles focused on the differences in experiencing pain, as well as in immune response, between the male and female sexes. Research conducted on male and female mice concerning pain stimuli revealed that female mice did not respond to the pain trigger, whereas male mice did. In addition to pain responses, immune responses vary across the sexes, and a proposed explanation as to why women have stronger immune responses involves evolutionary advantages, such that a stronger and faster immune response aids in the protection of fetus and newborn health. Furthermore, women are more likely to develop autoimmune diseases, and one possible reason for this is that because of the stronger and faster immune response that presented an evolutionary advantage, the immune systems of women overwork, overreact, and can eventually harm the body itself. The readings explained that some factors that can lead to observed differences in immune response may also include hormones like oestrogen and genetic factors, such as having two X chromosomes, which can amplify the effect of proteins on this chromosome. In terms of pain, the hormone oestrogen can either reduce or exacerbate the pain experienced, which can be compared to testosterone, although there isn't extensive research on how testosterone affects pain. Researchers have discovered that there are two "routes" to pain across male and female mice, but the practicality of applying this to test trials of drugs that are sex-specific and can help humans is not very likely at the moment. In fact, it may not be enough to just consider sex differences in pain pathways, as the article suggests that if customizable drugs were to be developed, they should also consider hormonal and genetic differences as well.

A note that these articles made was a reference to the 2014 NIH mandate that researchers report the sex of animals used in their studies, and how this was ultimately not inclusively effective in all research because the NIH does not have a rigorous form of regulating this requirement, and many studies omit experimenting on the female sex because menstrual cycles and pregnancy "complicate" results. What can be done to ensure that research studies effectively consider the factor of sex, as well as other differentiating factors so that the results of such studies are more applicable to a greater population size? Should this be a priority, considering that adding in these factors "complicates" results? Also, are customizable drugs that are sex-specific, or even hormonally or genetically specific an effective solution? </p>

            <h3>Autoimmune Disease</h3>
            <p>These two articles focused on the intersection of sex (chromosomes) and autoimmune disease, highlighting the fact that autoimmune diseases are more prevalent in women at nearly double the rate than they are in men. Essentially, autoimmune disease is defined as the condition where an individual’s immune system cannot distinguish harmful antigens from its own, healthy cells. A possible explanation for the higher rate of autoimmune disease among women is that the presence of two X chromosomes yields a greater risk of developing mutations in these chromosomes, as an X chromosome is much larger than the Y chromosome and has more genes. The presence of two X chromosomes and the process of X inactivation, where genes in each cell in each chromosome are turned off to prevent gene overexpression, make up one of the leading theories for the observed ratio of autoimmune disease between the two sexes. One fact that stood out to me from the research article is that during puberty, hormonal changes can increase the risk of autoimmune disease in women, so this is not just a concern for women that are aging or have started other hormonal changes, such as perimenopause. Other times of hormonal change include pregnancy or other stressful experiences that women go through.  The article, “The Importance of Sex” also revealed a key point to understanding how the evolution of the placenta and the influence of hormones like oestriol can help explain sex differences in autoimmune diseases. Women have fewer children than their ancestors did, which indicates a reduced interaction of the female body with the placenta, and thus greater risk for autoimmune disease because the placenta can help regulate the immune system by first increasing inflammation during pregnancy, and later producing anti-inflammatory hormones for protection.

These articles also brought up an interesting point of how aside from the lack of diversity among research subjects or cells (about male and female sex), there is also a lack of diversity among the researchers, as studying autoimmune disease is regarded as a women’s issue. I also thought it was interesting that less than 1% of Asian and African-American individuals experience psoriasis, but it is seen at a rate of 11% among Scandinavian and Caucasian populations. What could be the cause(s) of such differences in this autoimmune disorder and why does it disproportionately affect certain ethnic groups? This disease in particular also appears to more severely affect men that are afflicted, and I’d be interested to learn more about why this is. </p>

            <h3>Brain Basics</h3>
            <p>This article presented data from a study that observed over 10 million young adults in the military, testing the hypothesis that the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) causes, or can be one of the causes of multiple sclerosis (MS). Although the results do not conclusively show that EBV does in fact cause MS, this study has opened the door for further research into this relationship with its results. An interesting detail the researchers took into account was the assessment of environmental, socioeconomic, and racial/ethnic differences' effects on the predisposition to MS. For instance, they measured antibodies against CMV, which is a herpesvirus that disproportionately affects certain groups in the US population, and found that the risk of MS was lower in individuals that were CMV-positive. Furthermore, MS symptoms may occur years after the onset of pathological changes, which calls for observation through a biomarker instead of physical symptoms. Thus, the researchers measure neurofilament light chain and found that there was "neuroaxonal degeneration" after EBV infection, which suggests that EBV infection can be recognized before MS symptoms and pathological changes. I was surprised to learn that EBV affects 95% of adults, and that overall, only one of the 801 MS cases was detected in someone that was EBV-negative</p>

              <h3>Neurodegenerative Diseases</h3>
              <p>This article explains that sex is a significant, yet overlooked factor in neurodegenerative disease research, and specifically, microglial research, which is an area focusing on how microglial cells respond to inflammation in the brain. Differences in microglia across sexes begin in embryonic and early postnatal life, continuing into adulthood as well. An interesting discovery is that a high-fat diet caused an upregulation of genes that trigger an immune response and inflammation in microglia in a 6-month-old female, but that this was not observed in males. The study also makes the claim that instead of centering research on microglia to only reveal insights about whether or not microglial cells are activated, research must divert its attention to the stimulus that triggers microglial change. The article provides significant evidence from previous studies that reveal sex-related differences in microglia in Alzheimer’s disease and microglial metabolism. Additionally, the article makes note of the underrepresentation of women in clinical trials, a topic we have discussed before, and the possibility of sex-specific treatments.

Some of the studies mentioned used animals for research, and the article implies that applying such studies to clinical settings is difficult. Although there are benefits to using animals for research, what are the limitations in doing so, especially considering hormone treatment that is sex-specific? Is such a treatment likely to be available in the near future?
